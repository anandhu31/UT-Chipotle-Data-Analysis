# UT-Chipotle-Data-Analysis
This project is under a MIT license and this data set was obtained by asking people walking on Guadalupe Street 4 questions. The results of the questions are shown in the table. This data helps visualize and compare UT students' orders at Chipotle. 

The following questions are the attributes for this data: White Rice or Brown Rice, Black Beans or Pinto Beans, Meat or Veggie, Guac or No Guac. The data was collected over a span of 2 days (50 participants each day) for a total of 100 responders. 

The data was logged on Google Sheets for easy calculation of the percentages. 

The original data can be accessed here: https://data.world/anandhu31/data-for-chipotle-survey/workspace/file?filename=Data+Collection+-+Sheet1.csv
or [Data Collection - Sheet1.csv](https://github.com/anandhu31/UT-Chipotle-Data-Analysis/files/8065974/Data.Collection.-.Sheet1.csv).

These were the pie charts produced for Day 1 (Titles are black - might be hard to see):

The data seems fairly accurate as both DAY's provide very similar results of white rice, black beans, meat and no guac.
