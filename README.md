# UT-Chipotle-Data-Analysis
This project is under a MIT license and this data set was obtained by asking people walking on Guadalupe Street 4 questions. The results of the questions are shown in the table. This data helps visualize and compare UT students' orders at Chipotle. 

The following questions are the attributes for this data: White Rice or Brown Rice, Black Beans or Pinto Beans, Meat or Veggie, Guac or No Guac. The data was collected over a span of 2 days (50 participants each day) for a total of 100 responders. 

The data was logged on Google Sheets for easy calculation of the percentages.
